TODO:
	General:
	    * Transfer sdvx commands out of commands.py and into its own file for readability / future commands
		* Music streaming

	SDVX:
		* Minimum fuzzy ratio to get rid of irrelevant searches
		* Allow updates by sdvx.in ID

    Bugs:
        * SDVX override direct url: if it exists, it'll parse through all of the sort lists again
